Explain how you collected the data:
The data was collected over two consecutive days (12/2/2022-12/3/2022), and is taken from this website: 
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. The names, total deaths, and daily deaths of 25 different countries
were collected. The scrape_country function collects the data by using the requests library to get the HTML of 
the website and then using the BeautifulSoup library to parse through the HTML and gather the relevant data. The
data is then returned as a dictionary.


Explain how the JSON is organized:
There is a separate JSON file for each day that data is collected. Each JSON file contains a list of dictionaries,
where each dictionary contains the info for a country (name, total deaths normalized by 1M, daily deaths). This
JSON file can be read into a script to manipulate and view the data.
